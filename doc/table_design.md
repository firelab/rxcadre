## Summary

This document describes the simple schema for the RX Cadre table schema.  The
project is designed to visualize anemometer (cup and vane) data as well as fire
behavior package (FBP) data.  There are several tables and associated
meta-tables that have to be updated and populated to use the visualization.

## Tables

### Plot Location (plot\_location)

Plot location describes the names of the plot _location_ for each point.  All
plots are described as points.  Geometry is stored as OGC well-known text
geometry (POINT( x y )).  Plot type may be used to extract other data from
tables.

| project\_name | plot\_id | x         | y         | wkt\_geometry              | plot\_type |
| ------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------| -------------------------- | ---------- |
| 'RX Cadre'    | KYLE\_1  | -113.99   | 47.01     | POINT(-113.99 47.01)       | CUP\_VANE  |
| 'RX Cadre'    | KYLE\_2  | -114.0043 | 45.044856 | POINT(-114.0043 45.044856) | FBP        |

PRIMARY\_KEY(plot\_id)

### Observation tables (obs\_tables)

This table describes which values from which observation tables can be
displayed.  All observation tables should be registered in this table.  The
_obs\_table\_name_ must be a name in the database.  _obs\_cols_ are the column
names that hold observation data, comma separated.  _obs\_col\_names_ are
human-readable strings for each column, comma separated.

| obs\_table\_name | geometry\_column | obs\_cols                 | obs\_col\_names                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| cup\_vane\_obs   | wkt_geometry     | 'dir,speed,gust'          | 'Direction,Speed(mph),Gust(mph)' |
| fbp\_obs         | wkt_geometry     | 'tmp,ksh,ksv,mtr,mtt,nar' | 'Temperature(C),Horizontal Wind Speed(m/s),Vertical Wind Speed(m/s),Medtherm Radiant Flux(kw/m^2),Medtherm Total Heat Flux(kw/m^2),Narrow Angle Radiometer(kw/m^2)' |

PRIMARY\_KEY(obs\_table\_name)

### Event table

The event table holds pre-determined events for a given project.  The table
specifies the start and end time for some event for subsetting temporally.

| project\_name | event\_name | event\_start    | event\_end      |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 'RX Cadre'    | 'S1'        | '20120912T1243' | '20120912T1534' |
| 'RX Cadre'    | 'S4'        | '20120914T1822' | '20120914T1930' |


PRIMARY\_KEY(project\_name, event\_name)

#### _Notes_\:

This table is not necessary, it only allows for pre-determined events.  Queries
can be made by using start/end times.

### Various observation tables

These tables hold actual observations.  The schema is not standard, but in
order to be used, it must be registered with the obs\_tables table.  The
following are examples.

#### Table cup\_vane\_obs

| plot\_id | timestamp                  | dir | speed | gust |
| -------- | -------------------------- | --- | ----- | ---- |
| A10      | 'Sep 12, 2012 08:34:32 PM' | 182 | 19    | 33   |
| A10      | 'Sep 12, 2012 08:34:35 PM' | 166 | 12    | 15   |
